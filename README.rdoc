=Introduction

Gee... it sure would be awesome if ActiveResource _actually_ allowed us to do client-side validation of our ActiveResource objects
like the ActiveResource::Base documentation promises[http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveResource/Base]


=Installation

To install, add this to your environment.rb: 

  config.gem 'veracious', :version => '0.0.2', :lib => 'veracious', :source => 'http://gemcutter.org'

Next, go to the root of your project in a shell and run this command (you may need to use "sudo" depending on your environment): 

  sh# rake gems:install 
  
=Usage

You can now create a protected "validate" method in your ActiveResource::Base-derived class: 

  class Book < ActiveResource::Base
    self.site = 'http://myservice.domain'
    
    protected
    def validate
      errors.add(:author, 'is required') if (author.blank? rescue true)
    end
  end

Now, in your code, you can do the following:

  console> b = Book.new
  console> b.valid?
    ==> false
  console> b.author = ''
  console> b.valid?
    ==> false
  console> b.author = 'Iain M. Banks'
  console> b.valid?
    ==> true

When you call the _valid?_ method on your active resource object, it will do client side validation. It will *not* send a request to the service provider for validation.
